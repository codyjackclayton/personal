# Objective
The objective of this project is to identify auto insurance buyers who have a higher risk of submitting a claim within the first year of the policy based on the information available at the time of purchase. 




```{r, , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

x = 100
```


# Assumptions required for results to be predictive in 2006 
1. The exposure must be available before the insurance policy is taken out and can therefore be used as a predictor of a claim at the time the insurance is purchased.  
2. The dataCar dataset must only indicate a vehicle has submitted a claim if the accident occurs in the first year. The dataset includes data from 2004 & 2005, if a policy was taken out in 2004 and was renewed in 2005 the 2005 renewal and any claim that happened after the renewal date should not be included.
